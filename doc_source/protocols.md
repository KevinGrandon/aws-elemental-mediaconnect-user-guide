# Protocols in AWS Elemental MediaConnect<a name="protocols"></a>

AWS Elemental MediaConnect supports three protocols for incoming \(source\) and outgoing \(output\) live video streams:
+ **Zixi** is the most reliable protocol offered\. We strongly recommend that you use this protocol for your AWS Elemental MediaConnect sources and outputs whenever possible, due to its reliability and ability to stream over longer distances\. If your encoder is not capable of using Zixi, you can use Zixi feeder software\. The Zixi receiver software \(a version specifically for AWS Elemental MediaConnect is available [here](http://www.zixi.com/aws-mediaconnect-download)\) can also be used to receive the Zixi protocol in environments and on devices that don't support Zixi natively\. If you are setting up multiple flows for distribution, we recommend that you use Zixi as the protocol to send content between flows\. AWS Elemental MediaConnect supports two Zixi protocol options:
  + **Zixi pull** uses the Zixi protocol to send content to a receiver or an IRD \(integrated receiver decoder\) that is behind a firewall\. Additionally, you can use this option when network address translation \(NAT\) is needed to route the traffic from AWS Elemental MediaConnect to the receiver\.
  + **Zixi push** uses the Zixi protocol to send content to a receiver that has a static, publically addressable IP address\. Use this option when the receiver is not behind a firewall or NAT\-based router\.
+ **RTP\-FEC** has wide applicability and forward error correction \(FEC\) to self\-heal any corruption and packet loss\. Using this protocol takes more bandwidth than RTP without FEC\.
+ **RTP** has wide applicability and takes less bandwidth than RTP\-FEC\.
